		<h1>Project 2</h1>
		
		<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
		<p>I am most inspired by <a href="http://www.therivetpress.com"> therivetpress.com</a> and <a href="http://www.risotteriamelottinyc.com">risotteriamelottinyc.com</a></p>
		
		<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
		<dl>
			<dt><em>Use of space</em></dt>
					<dd>For The Rivet Press, I find that the usage of space is very effective and pleasant to the eyes. What makes it a much more pleasant website for me to continue reading is the consistent spacing, and the clean distinction between positive and negative space. They have also applied the "Rule of Thirds" to put the most important topics that they want to draw the reader's attention to on the largest spot on the left hand 3rd of the webpage. For less important information, they display it at the top and bottom of the webpage in consistent grid layout with consistent margin spacing. It's as if a lot of miscellaneous info gives the "framing" of the larger topics. 
					</dd>
					<dd>For Risotteria Melotti's website, I find that the usage of space is slightly less efficient. However, there are still plenty of good qualities. For example, everything is in a uniform grid/column system to guide the eyes. There is a clear distinction of positive and negative space. However, everything is a little bit all over the place I feel because there is not consistent margin spacing throughout the page, and the color blocking seems a little off showing up on the browser. Over all though, the content is still very clear due to equal spacing and clean layout.
					</dd>
			<dt><em>Use of size</em></dt>
					<dd>For the Rivert Press, the use of size is very appropriate. The main topics, such as online shopping of men and women jeans are in larger fonts versus the rest of the texts. At the same time, I feel that the smaller texts have equal spacing between the words for uniformity and ease of reading for the viewers. There is for sure a difference between the larger and smaller fonts, but at the same time, not too much to confuse the viewers.
					</dd>
					<dd>For Risotteria Melotti's website, the use of size is pretty distinct also. All important headings like menu, newsletter, and etc are in larger fonts while the less important information or details are in smaller and lighter fonts. Since it's a restaurant website, all food photos are large and prominent to draw the viewer's eyes to the delicious food that this restaurant has to offer.
					</dd>
			<dt><em>Use of balance</em></dt>
				<dd>For the Rivet Press, there is a good use of balance between the spacing and size, such that the hierarchy of information is nicely presented. Even for the photos/images on the website, they also follow the same positive and negative space motiff. The photos are not overwelming to the readers. In large photos, I feel like the webpage designer purposedly chooses to have a black and white motiff for the ease of the reader's eyes. However, they will emphasize the product that they are selling still by having a blurred background, and a sharp focus in the center. In the meantime, for the less focused information on the top and bottom of the page, because it is already in the "background," the design will put colors on the miscellaneous/less focused topic that they want to draw the reader's eyes to and catch our attention that way.</p>
				</dd>
				<dd>For Risotteria Melotti's website, I feel there's a good balance between the spacing and size. Out of all the interactive pages, I like this the most because even though it's fun to click around the images and the columns layout change as I scroll down the pages, the website is still relatively clean. The videos are located at center of the page, clean location, so it does not clutter my browswer or my eyes too much. Its negative space is not too dense even though there are a lot of picture contents. Overall, I find this website pretty well built. The photos are clean and crisp without any cluttering.
				</dd>

		<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
		<p> Both websites share a good hierarchy in presenting their information via the use of spacing and size. They both layout in columns and rows while maintaining relatively consistent spacing to guide the viewers to follow the trend of information that they want to present. The more important concepts/themes are in clean large fonts, and the details in lighter and less prominent fonts. The main difference between the two of them is that The Rivet Press obviously follows a pretty straight flat design principle with clean edges, simple shapes, and color blocking scheme; while Risotteria Melotti's website leans more towards skeuomorphism, with realistic photos, videos, and interactive buttons/links.

		<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>
		<dl>
			<dt><strong>Home Page Version 1</strong></dt>
				<img src="Unit2images/HomePage1.png" alt="HomePage Version 1" width="50%">
				<p>The focal point of this website is on recipes, so I decide to put the image of a featured meal as center of the page. Another focus of this website is to provide the viewers with recipes of quick and easy meals, and recipes of meals that will be more time consuming to prepare. I try to convey these two main ideas by keeping the home page simple into these two ideas. I utilize the negative space by keeping it consistent and clean, so the readers will not feel overwhelmed by choices. Additionally, all subtitles are organized in equal grid format to present a clean design to the viewers.
				</p>
			<dt><strong>Home Page Version 2</strong></dt>
				<img src="Unit2images/HomePage2.png" alt="HomePage Version 2" width="50%">
				<p>Similarly, version 2 of the home page tries to achieve a clean hierarchy by keeping food recipes as the focus of the website. Texts will be minimal, and the images of different food will be the focus. Once again though, I want to emphasize the importance of time consuming cooking vs quick and easy cooking, so aside from the title of the meals, I also choose to indicate time on each of the food images when the viewers use the cursor to hover over them. Just like previously, I realize that it might be overwhelming with so many images, so all of them are laid out evenly with equal spacing and size along with equal margins. (Please note that Home Page Version 2 does not have Sub-Page at this point. Clicking the image will lead the readers directly into the detail/recipe page.)
				</p>
			<dt><strong>Sub-Page Version 1</strong></dt>
				<img src="Unit2images/SubPage1.png" alt="SubPage Version 1" width="50%">
				<p>The focal point of this sub-page is to further guide the readers in choosing a recipe of their liking from Home Page Version 1. The hierarchy of this page is shown by dividing the 3 subtopics into equal columns and rows, and placing larger font size for the title of each subtopic. I try to create a balance by giving a dark background for the sub-page's title, and a light/white background for the images. I try to guide the viewer eyes vertically down the page, after they decide which protein they want to eat for dinner on top.
				</p>
			<dt><strong>Sub-Page Version 2</strong></dt>
				<img src="Unit2images/SubPage2.png" alt="SubPage Version 2" width="50%">
				<p>Similarly, in version 2, the focal point of this sub-page is further guide the readers in choosing a recipe of their liking from Home Page Version 1. Therefore, the images of the recipes will be focus of this page. However, instead of guiding the viewers' eyes vertically down the page of each subtopics' recipes, I am guiding their eyes horizontally across the page. I create hierarchy by having the sub-page's title with the largest font, then follow by smaller fonts for the subtopics. By giving the same text background for the page title and subtopic titles, I try to create uniformity and clean design. Additionally, I placed all recipe images in an equal spacing 3-column grid. Just like in Version 1, the colorful images will have a light/white negative space, such that the background will not distract the focus of the message that I am trying to deliver.
				</p>
			<dt><strong>Detail Page Version 1</strong></dt>
				<img src="Unit2images/RecipePage1.png" alt="DetailPage Version 1" width="50%">
				<p>There are 3 main types of information I want to deliver in the detail page. Time it takes to prepare the food, ingredients needed, and instructions to complete the cooking. To convey that these 3 ideas are equally important, they all receive, the same size of larger fonts on the page. However, it's impossible almost to give them equal sizing in a grid layout because often times, ingredients' list will be much shorter in length in comparison to the instructions; therefore, I try to keep uniformity by having the same margin, same font spacing, and same line spacing between the details. Additionally, I try to appeal the readers of the end product by placing a colorful image on top next to the ingredients, to utilize the negative space next to the list. At the very end, I also want to suggest similar recipes to the readers. However, that's not the page focus, so I keep it minimal by using the smallest fonts, and the smallest image place holders to show similar recipes. 
				</p>
			<dt><strong>Detail Page Version 2</strong></dt>
				<img src="Unit2images/RecipePage1.png" alt="DetailPage Version 1" width="50%">
				<p>Similarly in version 2, I try to put time of preparation, ingredients needed, and instructions to complete as the focus of the page. However, instead of a 2-columns to 1-column design, I switch from a 1-column to 2-columns grid layout. I put the image of the final product on top to appeal the readers, almost using the image as an "eye candy" such that the readers will continue reading the directions to complete the meal. Just like before, all lists have equal margins and spacing to create a better flow for the viewers.
