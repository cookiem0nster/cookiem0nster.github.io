		<h2>About Me</h2>

		<p> I'm a construction engineer, living in New York. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I am interested in making my own websites whether it'd be about sharing delicious home cooking recipes or personal blogging. </p>
	

		<h4>My Mission</h4>
	
		<p> As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day to work as a partner in a company or start my own business because I like to work in a non-hierarchical and challening environment.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Assistant Engineer</strong></br><em>New York, 2010-2014</em></li>
		</ul>
	</br>

		<h4>Education</h4>
